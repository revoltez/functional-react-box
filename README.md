# React Truffle Box

the difference between this repository and the original truffle box is that instead of class components, functional components are used.
This box comes with everything you need to start using smart contracts from a react app. This is as barebones as it gets, so nothing stands in your way.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/revoltez/functional-react-box
cd Client/
yarn install
yarn start
```
